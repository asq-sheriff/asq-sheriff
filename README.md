# Hi, I'm Aejaz Sheriff 👋

## 🚀 Enterprise Architect turned AI Solutions architect
**Transforming 27 years of building mission-critical systems experience into creating production-ready AI solutions that actually scale**

After architecting healthcare systems that process millions of transactions, I'm now focused on building AI systems. I specialize in the crucial 90% of work that happens after the model is trained—authentication, compliance, scalability, and reliability.

### 🎯 What I'm Building
- **Production RAG Systems:** Multi-database architectures handling 1000+ concurrent users
- **Compliant AI:** HIPAA-eligible AI agents with built-in safety guardrails
- **Scalable Infrastructure:** Zero-downtime deployments with blue-green workflows
- **Open Source Tools:** Contributing to the gap between AI research and production
