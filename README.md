- ‚ö° Fun fact:
  "Did you hear about the company that implemented the 'reverse pyramid' model but ended up with an inverted pyramid of dysfunction?
  They had so many servant-leader project managers tripping over each other to 'support' the employees that no actual work could get done! The PMs spent all day asking the developers irrelevant questions, clearly not understanding the work the development team was doing.
  In meetings, the PMs kept interrupting each other with, 'No, I insist, how can I serve YOU?' and 'Please, let me be the one to remove any roadblocks for you!' Meanwhile, the employees sat back and watched the PM pile-up with amusement."
