## 🚀 Executive Profile

From 12 years as lead enterprise architect for Blue Cross Blue Shield (serving 6M+ members) to 10 years in IBM Labs and now Principal Architect at Pragmatic Logic AI, I develop production-grade AI healthcare platforms that meet rigorous clinical, regulatory, and operational requirements. I deliver FDA-ready therapeutic AI, robust MLOps, and resilient, scalable infrastructure—backed by real “hands on” delivery and 28 years industry mastery.

- **Clinical AI Quality:** Delivered 93.3/100 therapeutic quality scores—40% above national CMS 5-Star benchmarks—using responsible AI frameworks and cross-encoder architectures.
- **Enterprise & Healthcare Systems:** Deep mastery of architectures (TOGAF 9.1, HL7 FHIR, Epic/Cerner, EDI 837/835) and hands-on MLOps, event-driven integration, security.
- **Production Infrastructure:** 4-database RAG architectures, blue-green deployment (AWS/Terraform), multi-cloud, and full disaster recovery.
- **Regulatory Leadership:** HIPAA, CMS, ONC, FDA readiness—embedding compliance in every system.
